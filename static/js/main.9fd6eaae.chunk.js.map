Immediately after the crash, the driver gets up off the ground, draws his sword, and quickly runs to put himself between the shocked party and the downed carriage. “Stay back!” he says, “Don’t come any closer!” Between the shouts of the driver, the party can hear a multitude of whispers coming from the carriage.'\n};\n\nconst featureEncounters: EncounterTable = {\n    1: 'A huge cairn of stones carved with strange symbols rises from the nearby landscape, it is either a marker or the burial place of some forgotten hero (equal chance of each).',\n    2: 'A farmer\\'s hut and a field groaning with produce, however the cabin seems to have been abandoned and all possessions–save the produce in the field–taken.
