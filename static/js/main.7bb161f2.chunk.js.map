The party runs to investigate and find themselves facing a tense standoff between two identical-looking young men. They both have their swords drawn and are slowly circling each other while a young woman clutching two small children watches nervously. One says he was returning from a business trip when he found his doppelganger leading his family away; the other says he returned early from that trip to save his family from the danger he discovered they were in.',\n    30: 'As the party approaches a bend in the road, a carriage suddenly comes careening around the corner at tremendous speed. Spotting the party too late, the driver tries to swerve away but ends up losing traction and causing the carriage to topple over. Immediately after the crash, the driver gets up off the ground, draws his sword, and quickly runs to put himself between the shocked party and the downed carriage. “Stay back!” he says, “Don’t come any closer!” Between the shouts of the driver, the party can hear a multitude of whispers coming from the carriage.'\n};\n\nconst featureEncounters: EncounterTable = {\n    1: 'A huge cairn of stones carved with strange symbols rises from the nearby landscape, it is either a marker or the burial place of some forgotten hero (equal chance of each).',\n    2: 'A farmer\\'s hut and a field groaning with produce, however the cabin seems to have been abandoned and all possessions–save the produce in the field–taken.
